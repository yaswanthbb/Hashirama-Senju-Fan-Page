                        Hashirama Senju (千手柱間, Senju Hashirama) was a member of the famed Senju clan. 
                        He himself was hailed as the "God of Shinobi" for his unmatched ninja prowess. 
                        Hashirama sought peace for the shinobi world, and to that end founded Konohagakure with his clan,
                        his childhood friend and rival: Madara Uchiha and the Uchiha clan. He would later become the First Hokage
                        (初代火影, Shodai Hokage, literally meaning: First or Founding Fire Shadow) of Konohagakure.<br><br> Although he was
                        not able to achieve peace during his lifetime, his legacy and vision for the world would continue to shape
                        the village and the entire shinobi world even after his death.Hashirama was born during the Warring States Period,
                        the eldest of Butsuma Senju's four sons. Hashirama and his brothers grew up on the battlefield waging constant war
                        with the Senju's rivals: the Uchiha. During his infrequent downtime,<br><br>Hashirama met a boy his own age named Madara.
                        The two quickly developed a friendly rivalry, be it skipping stones or urinating in rivers, with Hashirama typically
                        winning their contests.Hashirama did not approve of this practice of sending children to fight and die, believing it
                        would only increase the bitterness between the Senju and Uchiha, thus causing more deaths.

                        Hashirama was famed as the strongest shinobi of his era and one of the strongest in history,
                        reputed as a God of Shinobi.Madara, another legendary shinobi, openly admitted inferiority
                        to Hashirama throughout their entire lifetime together, even with the Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan
                        and the Nine-Tails at his disposal.Through his unique powers, Hashirama had been able to subdue
                        and capture eight of the nine free-roaming tailed beasts on his own.<br><br>During the Fourth Shinobi World
                        War, Kabuto proclaimed that the man's might as a ninja was so vast that it was held in a fantasy light 
                        similar to the Sage of Six Paths, stating that no one, aside from Madara, had come close to matching 
                        him ever since his passing.As a Senju, and a reincarnation of Asura Ōtsutsuki,Hashirama possessed a 
                        powerful life-force and physical energy.<br><br>This made his chakra remarkably strong, and so dense that 
                        it could visibly affect his surroundings when released as powerful shockwaves.

                    <p class="para  " id="paragraphChange3">
                        Because of his large chakra reserves, Hashirama could use senjutsu and enter Sage Mode — a 
                        feat he could perform instantaneously.In this mode, he gains red (black in the anime) 
                        markings around and under his eyes as well in the middle of his forehead. While it is not 
                        known where he learned it, Hashirama proved formidable in its usage, riding about on his wood
                        techniques as a means to be mobile in battle while maintaining the stillness of one's self needed
                        to continue building up natural energy to keep this mode activated.<br><br> Hashirama could perform powerful
                        seals to bind targets, even those as large as the Ten-Tails.The power of Sage Mode would also greatly
                        augment his Wood Release, causing his constructs to become considerably larger and more dangerous, as seen
                        with his largest creation, the Sage Art Wood Release: True Several Thousand Hands: by using it to deliver 
                        an enormous barrage of punches, it could strip Susanoo from the Nine-Tails plus was chiefly responsible 
                        for the formation of the Valley of the End.<br><br>
